  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <table> <!-- Using the table tag, we can make a table to organize our info to make it look cleaner and more professional. Under the table tag, we added the "tr" tag which means table row. This added a row to our table. Then we divided the row into TWO cells using TWO "td" or "table cell" tags. Watch lesson 20. HTML Tables for more information on tables. -->
    <thead> <!-- We added three things to our table: The table header "thead", the table body "tbody", and the table foot "tfoot". We added the tr and td tags inside the table body. This is the correct format to create a table. -->
      <th>Dates</th> <!-- The table header cell "th" tag is adding a header for your table. It goes within the thead tag. It automatically bolds whatever is typed inisde it. -->
      <th>Career</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody> <!-- The tbody tag is the body of your table. The tr tag and td tags are included within the tbody tag. Follow this exact structer for making tables. -->
      <tr> <!-- The table row tag simply creates a row, there is no table column. The column is automatically created by adding the table cell tag "td". The more td tags you add, it adds HORIZONTALLY along the table, automatically creating columns. Watch lesson 20. HTML Tables timestamp 11:00 -->

  CATEGORY as your original website. In this case, the file created is called "contact.html," and it is on the same level as the "index.html" file. In the new file, you add the boiler plate and add what you want to this website. Once you finish, you have to link this webiste to your original website using the a tag.
  Learn more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a. The important thing to remember here is that the new file must be in the SAME category as your orignal website. On top of that, make sure to add ".html" so the website can load.  -->
